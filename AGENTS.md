# Project Overview

This is a Flutter project called "Novelty," a cross-platform novel viewer for the website "小説家になろう" (Let's Become a Novelist). The application is designed to provide an optimal reading experience, built from the ground up with a focus on simplicity and modern features. It is a client application for the "小説家になろう" website and is developed using the Flutter framework, ensuring a consistent and comfortable user experience across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

The project uses a modern and robust technology stack, including:
- **Framework:** Flutter
- **State Management:** Riverpod
- **Routing:** GoRouter
- **Database:** Drift (SQLite)
- **API Client:** Dio
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Building and Running

To set up the development environment and run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Flutter (stable channel)
- FVM (Flutter Version Management)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/L4Ph/Novelty.git
   cd Novelty
   ```
2. **Install the Flutter SDK using FVM:**
   ```bash
   fvm install
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   fvm flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run code generation:**
   ```bash
   fvm dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

### Running the Application
```bash
fvm flutter run
```

## Development Conventions

The project follows standard Flutter and Dart conventions. The code is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns. The use of Riverpod for state management and GoRouter for navigation indicates a modern and scalable architecture. The project also includes a comprehensive set of dependencies, managed using `pubspec.yaml`, and uses `build_runner` for code generation, which is common in modern Dart projects.
